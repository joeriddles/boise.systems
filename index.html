    <h1>Boise Systems</h1>

    <p>
      Boise Systems is a book club focused on systems
      programming. It is hosted in partnership with the <a href="https://www.meetup.com/bsdg-meetup/">Boise Software Developer’s Group (BSDG)</a>.
    </p>

      <h2>Schedule</h2>
    </a>

    <p>
      We are starting in January with our <a href="#book">first book</a>. We will cover one chapter per week. At twelve chapters, it should take about three months to complete the book.
    </p>

    <p>
      Each week, one participant will provide a quick summary of the chapter. They will also come prepared with a few questions for the group to help facilitate conversation.
    </p>

    <p>
      Conversation will be held asynchronously in the <a href="https://discord.gg/UdN2HgWEEa">#bookclub channel</a> of BSDG’s Discord server on the date listed in the table below. In-person conversations will also be held informally following BSDG’s monthly meetup.
    </p>

      <h2>Book</h2>
    </a>

    <p>
      The first book will be <a href="https://dataintensive.net/">Designing Data-Intensive Applications</a>:
    </p>

    <blockquote>
      <p>
        “NoSQL… Big Data… Scalability… CAP Theorem… Eventual Consistency… Sharding…
      </p>

      <p>
        Nice buzzwords, but how does the stuff actually <i>work</i>?
      </p>

      <p>
        As software engineers, we need to build applications that are reliable, scalable and maintainable in the long run. We need to understand the range of available tools and their trade-offs. For that, we have to dig deeper than buzzwords.
      </p>

      <p>
        This book will help you navigate the diverse and fast-changing landscape of technologies for storing and processing data. We compare a broad variety of tools and approaches, so that you can see the strengths and weaknesses of each, and decide what’s best for your application.”
      </p>
